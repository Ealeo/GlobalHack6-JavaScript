# GlobalHack6-JavaScript
Code used to create hellopuggie.dx.am for GlobalHack VI in St. Louis, Missouri, on October 21st-October 23rd, 2016. The point of this code is to act as a prevention method to homelessness. It plays out as a game similar to Lifeline, where the main character talks directly to the user, which is, in this case, a child. The user's response is cross-referenced with an array (acting as a minor database), searching for keywords. If a positive keyword is found, the game continues as normal. If a negative keyword is found,  the game deviates flags the negative keyword, and attempts to deduct why the negative keyword was used. If more negative keywords are found in consequent responses, it flags those as well. Should the user accrue three flags, the game will end. The idea is that it would send an email to the kid's school counselor detailing what was flagged and suggestions on how to address it, but I did not have the technical expertise to incorporate an e-mail-sending service in JavaScript. Also, it should be noted I had never used JavaScript once prior to that weekend, so I had to learn it in three hours.
